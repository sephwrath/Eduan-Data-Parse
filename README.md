# Eduan-Data-Parse
A script I wrote to help someone parse some data in R.

Reccomend downloading R https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ and Rstudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ - just the free desktop version... don't need RStudio but it will make it easier.

I've commented the code so you should be able to see how it works... let me know if you have any issues... can run it by opening the dataparse.r file in R studio and pasting I tested it on two copies of the same file -  just clear out the .dat files in the datparse dir and run it should be all good... hopefully the code is easy to follow though if you need to change anything.

# this sets the working directory so if you save it elsewhere change this
setwd("c:/datparse") 
# this runs the source file 
source("datparse.r")
